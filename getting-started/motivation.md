The Google Datastore is an amazing fast, reliable and flexible database for today's modern apps. But it's flexibility and schemaless nature can sometimes lead to a lot of duplicate code to validate the properties passed and their values.  

The pre & post 'hooks' found in Mongoose are also of great value when it comes to work with entities on a NoSQL database.

As it is built on top of the great google-cloud-node library, **all of its API** can still be accessed whenever needed.
